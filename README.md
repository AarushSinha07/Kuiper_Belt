# Kuiper Belt Using Reinforcement Learning


## Aim
The objective of the project was to stimulate and analyse an agent's behaviour in the Kuiper belt environment and hence train it to maximise its reward in the environment using reinforcement learning.


## Libraries
1. Numpy
2. Matplotlib
3. Gymnasium
   - gym_minigrid
   - gym_kuiper_escape

#### Frozen lake environment
To grasp the basics, it was necessary to implement initial problems and algorithms of reinforcement learning on a simpler environment, and the Frozen Lake environment was the perfect choice. In this environment, there was complete knowledge of its dynamics, allowing the algorithms to be designed with these specifics in mind, resulting in the best possible solution.
